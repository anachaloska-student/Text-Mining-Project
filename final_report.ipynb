    "The hotel industry is a big sector that everyone is included either as a customer, hotel owner or hotel worker. Besides providing their guests with a safe space to spend their night, hotels are selling an experience to their customers. The key concept for the hotels to improve the experience is processing the feedback from the customer. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Trip Advisor is an online platform where guests leave public reviews that is accessible to both hotels and customers. However, the quality of the customer feedback can vary and therefore make the review analysis harder for the hotels. For instance the emotion, quality of writing, and themes of the content can vary to a large extent from the numerical ratings assigned by the reviewer; hence, information from the text can potentially yield insights not indicated in the ratings for how hotels can improve their operations and better meet customer expectations (Inkpen et al., 2009).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In the analysis of this review, opinion mining is the key concept to explore useful insights. Opinion mining aids decision support by optimising the decision-making process, helps stakeholders to understand human preferences, aggregates opinions from many humans at once to assess a more general opinion (Zhai & Massung, 2016). When these techniques are applied to unstructured review data acquired from TripAdvisor, significant contributions can be made to the hotel industry.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "According to *Customer Management IQ survey filled by customer management executives and leaders in 2017*, customer feedback is a priority for the hotel industry’s efforts toward continuous improvement. Nevertheless, a comprehensive characterisation of the customer experience remains difficult to achieve, in spite of (or perhaps because of) the immense volume of guest commentary on the web (Inkpen et al., 2009). To achieve this improvement, analysis of online review content presents an opportunity for greater clarity (Han et al., 2016)"
