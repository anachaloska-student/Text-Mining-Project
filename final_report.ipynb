    "### Research Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What makes hotel guests particularly satisfied?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do hotel ratings coincide with the content of the reviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hotel industry is a big sector that everyone is included either as a customer, hotel owner or hotel worker. Besides providing their guests with a safe space to spend their night, hotels are selling an experience to their customers. The key concept for the hotels to improve the experience is processing the feedback from the customers.. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Trip Advisor is an online platform where guests leave public reviews that is accessible to both hotels and customers. However, the quality of the customer feedback can vary and therefore make the review analysis harder for the hotels. For instance the emotion, quality of writing, and themes of the content can vary to a large extent from the numerical ratings assigned by the reviewer; hence, information from the text can potentially yield insights not indicated in the ratings for how hotels can improve their operations and better meet customer expectations (Inkpen et al., 2009).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In the analysis of this review, opinion mining is the key concept to explore useful insights. Opinion mining aids decision support by optimising the decision-making process, helps stakeholders to understand human preferences, aggregates opinions from many humans at once to assess a more general opinion (Zhai & Massung, 2016). When these techniques are applied to unstructured review data acquired from TripAdvisor, significant contributions can be made to the hotel industry.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "According to *Customer Management IQ survey filled by customer management executives and leaders in 2017*, customer feedback is a priority for the hotel industry’s efforts toward continuous improvement. Nevertheless, a comprehensive characterisation of the customer experience remains difficult to achieve, in spite of (or perhaps because of) the immense volume of guest commentary on the web (Inkpen et al., 2009). To achieve this improvement, analysis of online review content presents an opportunity for greater clarity (Han et al., 2016)"

    "<br> A dataset composed of hotel reviews, which is available through __[the website of Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jiweil/html/hotel-review.html)__, was used in this study. Myle Ott, who works in the area of opinion analysis, collected this data through the API provided by TripAdvisor. \n",

For our research only the keys ratings and text are relevant. That it because ratings contain the numerical scores for each of the topics service, cleanliness, rooms, sleep quality, value, and location. The numerical scores are discrete values in the range from 0 to 5. The key text contains the textual reviews of a hotel customer. Usually, they contain information related to the guests experinece during the hotel stay. The value of the ratings consists of key-value pairs between service, cleanliness, value, location, sleep quality, and rooms on a scale from 1 to 5. Furthermore, review descriptions include title, text, and author information and review information including ID, location, and date.\n",

The dataset includes more information than it is needed to answer the research questions of the project. Therefore, only the related information will be used in the data processing. "

    "### Methodology\n",
    "We have four separate files that together provide the code for the analysis of our project; \n",
    "1.    Preprocessing the data: parse_text_json_sentences.ipynb;\n",
    "2.    Emotion analysis: get_data_sentences.ipynb;\n",
    "3.    Sentence based analysis: analyse_data_sentences.ipynb;\n",
    "4.    Final results and visualization: final_analysis.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing the data** <br>\n",
    "This section of the code is made to retrieve the textual reviews from the given dataset. First, we start by removing unnecessary information from the data, such as the title, author, date_stayed, and identification numbers from the reviews. We keep the numerical, 1-5 star-based, ratings, and the textual comments, further known as reviews. To these reviews we apply several techniques to obtain a more universal data set, such as lowercasing; removing reviews written in a language other than English; removing reviews with incomplete numerical ratings (where the length the dictionary called ‘rating’ is shorter than 7). Furthermore, we collected the textual reviews of all the entries in the dataset in one list, this is the list we will be using for further analysis, and is saved in the file 'review_sentences.json'. Additionally, we saved the numerical ratings, and calculate the average numerical ratings for each of the topics (cleanliness, service, rooms, location, overall, sleep_quality, value). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emotional Analysis** <br>\n",
    "This file reads the 'review_sentences.json' text file and assigns values for each emotion associated with each word in the reviews of the dataset. First, we create a vocabulary, using the 'NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-v0.92-English.csv' lexicon. Second, we find the eight emotions we are discussing from the ‘categories.json’ file that goes together with the lexicon. Third, we check for each word in the review whether it matches a word in the vocabulary, and we add that word to our data list. This list contains 11 columns, namely: English word, anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, disgust, sentence (index of the sentence the word is part of), review (index of review the word is part of). Finally, we create a CSV file called 'output_data_sentences.csv' with all output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sentence-based Analysis** <br>\n",
    "This code exists out of two separate parts, that both give numerical values to each sentence, one based on the emotions and the other based on the topics of the sentence. First, for the emotional part, we create a list of lists with sentences, with in each list a section of the 'output_data_sentences.csv' file. As this file contains a binary 1 or 0 in each column for each word in the reviews, we split the words into sentences by looking at the column ‘sentence’. In this process, we also check whether the sentences are not empty. With this list, we assign a score for each of our eight emotions to each sentence. We do this by summing the number of times an angry word, for example, is used in each sentence, and dividing that by the number of words in the sentence. This is saved in ‘analysis_output_sentences.json’ for further use.\n",
    "Furthermore, for the topics part of this code, we find all words related to our six topics (cleanliness, service, value, location, sleep_quality, and room), by adding the synonyms to a list by using WordNet Synsets. We create a matrix of zeros, with the index of the sentences as rows and the index of the six topics as columns. Then, for each sentence, we check whether one of the synonyms is mentioned in the sentence; if so, we add the value 1 to that specific (row x column) combination. This is all saved in the ‘topics.json’ file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Results and Visualisation**<br>\n",
    "This code reads out the ‘topics.json’ file with the topics per sentences, and the ‘analysis_output_sentences.json’ file with the emotion per sentences. We create two matrices that give the values for emotions and topics associated with each sentence. Additionally, we compute the dot product of the each of the columns of the topics matrix and the entire emotions matrix. Finally, we plot the values for the overall emotions associated with each topic in 6 different bar plots which, together with the Average Rating bar plot from the Preprocessing code (‘parse_text_json_sentences.ipynb’), are used in the analysis of the results of this research and in answering the targeted research questions."

    "To answer the first research question, we referred to the scores of the emotions trust and joy. From the graphs representing the scores for joy and trust versus the categories, we conclude that cleanliness, service, and rooms induce joy and trust in the costumers. Thus, these attributes should be cared the most by the hotel staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the second research question we looked at the average numerical scores. The topics with highest average ratings also include sleep quality, which means that the numerical ratings do not completely relate to the review texts. Which means that the numerical ratings are not entirely representative of the quality because the text reviews give a more extensive evaluation and make a better distinction between the most important attributes. Because the numerical ratings are discrete values while text review enables the customers to use a wider range that can be considered as rather continuous compared to numerical ratings. Namely, by looking at the bar plot of average numerical rating, one can see that they are very similar compared to emotion score analysis of the categories."

    "** Limitations **\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the method we followed gave us interesting insights to emotions customers associated with cleanliness, service, location, value, sleep quality, and room, these results could have been more representative if our algorithm and methodology was improved more, which can be done in future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, our algorithm can only process the comments in English, yet there was a significant number of reviews in other languages such as French, German, and Spanish. If we were to extend our code with the inclusion of other lexicons, the probability of excluding vital reviews that received high reputation from other trip advisor users would be decreased meaning that, the content we produced could be more inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other limitation we observed in our code is related to our application of WordNet. Initially, we tried to retrieve the synsets for the main rating categories using WordNet. However, after carefully implementing the code, we recognised that WordNet did not provide us with many synonyms for the categories we chose. Therefore, we created the synsets with a rather manual method. We checked online dictionaries to find the related concepts and added them manually to our code. If we have seen a better method to bypass this problem, the synsets included in our code could be more consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the data we could run through our algorithm was approximately 0.25% of the complete data set of 878561 reviews. As machine learning algorithms give better results with greater data training, our algorithm can return better and more extensive results if trained with more data. So, in a nutshell, although our results are not inaccurate, we could have obtained a more accurate result if the algorithm was run on the whole dataset."

    "In our resulting bar plots, we achieved to present that joy and trust are more tightly associated with cleanliness, service, and rooms regarding the hotel industry. In the light of the reviews, we concluded that higher ratings for our categories were reflected as high scores for anticipation, trust, and joy. Mainly, trust and joy remained the same regardless of the categories the ratings belonged to. Moreover, the review content showed more anticipation regarding sleep quality, value, and room. However, to compare this emotion to the actual numerical ratings, we should have first categorised our reviews based on the numerical ratings they had and then compared them to the emotion scores they had. A revised methodology to acquire such an automated comparison would be more insightful to answer the second research question. "
