    "\n",
    "1. What makes hotel guests particularly satisfied?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do hotel ratings coincide with the content of the reviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hotel industry is a big sector that everyone is included either as a customer, hotel owner or hotel worker. Besides providing their guests with a safe space to spend their night, hotels are selling an experience to their customers. The key concept for the hotels to improve the experience is processing the feedback from the customer. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Trip Advisor is an online platform where guests leave public reviews that is accessible to both hotels and customers. However, the quality of the customer feedback can vary and therefore make the review analysis harder for the hotels. For instance the emotion, quality of writing, and themes of the content can vary to a large extent from the numerical ratings assigned by the reviewer; hence, information from the text can potentially yield insights not indicated in the ratings for how hotels can improve their operations and better meet customer expectations (Inkpen et al., 2009).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In the analysis of this review, opinion mining is the key concept to explore useful insights. Opinion mining aids decision support by optimising the decision-making process, helps stakeholders to understand human preferences, aggregates opinions from many humans at once to assess a more general opinion (Zhai & Massung, 2016). When these techniques are applied to unstructured review data acquired from TripAdvisor, significant contributions can be made to the hotel industry.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "According to *Customer Management IQ survey filled by customer management executives and leaders in 2017*, customer feedback is a priority for the hotel industry’s efforts toward continuous improvement. Nevertheless, a comprehensive characterisation of the customer experience remains difficult to achieve, in spite of (or perhaps because of) the immense volume of guest commentary on the web (Inkpen et al., 2009). To achieve this improvement, analysis of online review content presents an opportunity for greater clarity (Han et al., 2016)"

    "### Methodology\n",
    "We have four separate files that together provide the code for the analysis of our project; \n",
    "1.\tPreprocessing the data: parse_text_json_sentences.ipynb;\n",
    "2.\tEmotion analysis: get_data_sentences.ipynb;\n",
    "3.\tSentence based analysis: analyse_data_sentences.ipynb;\n",
    "4.\tFinal results and visualization: final_analysis.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1.\tPreprocessing the data <br>\n",
    "This section of the code is made to retrieve the textual reviews from the given dataset. First, we start by removing unnecessary information from the data, such as the title, author, date_stayed, and identification numbers from the reviews. We keep the numerical, 1-5 star-based, ratings, and the textual comments, further known as reviews. To these reviews we apply several techniques to obtain a more universal data set, such as lowercasing; removing reviews written in a language other than English; removing reviews with incomplete numerical ratings (where the length the dictionary called ‘rating’ is shorter than 7). Furthermore, we collected the textual reviews of all the entries in the dataset in one list, this is the list we will be using for further analysis, and is saved in the file 'review_sentences.json'. Additionally, we saved the numerical ratings, and calculate the average numerical ratings for each of the topics (cleanliness, service, rooms, location, overall, sleep_quality, value). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Emotional Analysis <br>\n",
    "This file reads the 'review_sentences.json' text file and assigns values for each emotion associated with each word in the reviews of the dataset. First, we create a vocabulary, using the 'NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-v0.92-English.csv' lexicon. Second, we find the 8 emotions we are discussing from the ‘categories.json’ file that goes together with the lexicon. Third, we check for each word in the review whether it matches a word in the vocabulary, and we add that word to our data list. This list contains 11 columns, namely: english word, anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, disgust, sentence (index of the sentence the word is part of), review (index of review the word is part of). Finally, we create a csv file called 'output_data_sentences.csv' with all output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sentence-based analysis <br>\n",
    "This code exists out of two separate parts, that both give numerical values to each sentence, one based on the emotions and the other based on the topics of the sentence. First for the emotional part, we create a list of lists with sentences, with in each list a section of the 'output_data_sentences.csv' file. As this file contains a binary 1 or 0 in each column for each word in the reviews, we split the words into sentences by looking at the column ‘sentence’. In this process we also check whether the sentences are not empty. With this list, we can assign a score for each of our 8 emotions to each sentence. We do this by summing the amount of times an angry word, for example, is used in each sentence, and dividing that by the amount of words in the sentence. This is saved in ‘analysis_output_sentences.json’ for further use.\n",
    "Furthermore, for the topics part of this code, we find all words related to our 6 topics (cleanliness, service, value, location, sleep_quality, and room), by adding the synonyms to a list by using WordNet Synsets. We create a matrix of zeros, with the index of the sentences as rows and the index of the 6 topics as columns. Then, for each sentence, we check whether one of the synonyms is mentioned in the sentence; if so, we add the value 1 to that specific (row x column) combination. This is all saved in the ‘topics.json’ file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Results and visualisation <br>\n",
    "This code reads out the ‘topics.json’ file with the topics per sentences, and the ‘analysis_output_sentences.json’ file with the emotion per sentences. We create two matrices that give the values for emotions and topics associated with each sentence. Additionally, we compute the dot product of the each of the columns of the topics matrix and the entire emotions matrix. Finally, we plot the values for the overall emotions associated with each topic in 6 different bar plots which, together with the Average Ratings bar plot from the Preprocessing code (‘parse_text_json_sentences.ipynb’), are used in the analysis of the results of this research and in answering the targeted research questions.\n"
